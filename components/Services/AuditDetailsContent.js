                                        <h4></h4>
                                        <ul>

                                                <h4>Technical Crawl</h4>In short, we comb through the structure of your website and use special tools to crawl for errors, missing items, mobile compatibility, duplicate contents or page speed issues that could hinder Search Engines to crawl and rank your site.
                                            </li>

                                                <h4>Keyword Research</h4>The simplest tool for improving search engine results, keywords and phrases are commonly-searched terms that relate directly to your company and products. It is important to use the right keywords and phrases often enough within your content so that search engines will crawl and rank your website. We will analyze your keyword focus throughout your site content and evaluate opportunities for improvement.
                                            </li>

                                                <h4>Site Layout</h4>Websites that are easy to navigate and have clear calls to action perform better in search results than those that are not. You must remove any features that customers will find distracting or confusing, or slow down your site. Removing these issues allow users to move from page to page with as few barriers as possible.
                                            </li>

                                                <h4>Mobile Optimization</h4>A growing percentage of online searches are performed on smartphones and tablets. Top search engines have changed their algorithm so that mobile friendly sites now get ranked higher in SERPs (Search Engine Result Pages) than those who are not. On the flip, non-mobile sites get ranked lower. And that's dangerous for your business. We check your site for compatibility with mobile platforms or other issues and report back to you.
