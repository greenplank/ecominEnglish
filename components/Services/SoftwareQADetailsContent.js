                                    <p>Software quality assurance (also known as "QA" or "software testing" ) is crucial part of the modern software development today.</p>
                                    <p>It can be explained as the continuous testing of the developed software. QA is here to ensure quality of software products or services.</p>
                                    <p>It is not just about finding problems, but also about preventing them, proposing solutions and providing feedback to stakeholders.</p>
                                    <p>Software testing involves a number of disciplines - from requirements analysis through testing itself to writing automated tests.</p>
                                    <p>Among other things, automated quality assurance tests are very helpful in detecting bugs that a normal person can no longer figure out (usually, for example, the context and continuity of different systems).</p>

                                    <h3>Test planning</h3>
                                    <p>Testing starts long before first line of code is written. Do you need to create test plan for a Project or define Test strategy for whole company? We are here to help you describing the scope, approach, resources and schedule of intended test activities.</p>
                                    <h3>Manual testing</h3>
                                    <p>We perform manual tests at any stage of development and at any level - Integration, System, Acceptance. With each client, we always try to come up with a suitable set of all tests needed to guarantee the quality of the given software.</p>
                                    <h3>Automation testing</h3>
                                    <p>Once tests are written the best approach is to automate them to save time and resources. We are here to choose the best approach for automation testing on any level. We offer GUI automated tests (In selenium or Cypress), Backend or API automated tests (Postman, ReadyAPI).</p>
                                    <h3>Non-function testing</h3>
                                    <p>We can also test non-function requirements on software such as performance or security. Do you need to simulate thousands of people using your software or does your software need to meet security standards such as ISO/IEC 27001 and 27002? We have specialists in non-functional testing that can do that for you.</p>
                                    <h3>Outsource your software testing (QA) to us</h3>

                                    <h3>Full-Cycle Development Process</h3>
