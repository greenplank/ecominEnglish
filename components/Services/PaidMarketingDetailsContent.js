                                    <h3>PPC Setup Process</h3>
                                    <p>When we first talk with new companies, they always ask how we plan to onboard their account. So, here’s how we do it: </p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li><b>Step 1</b><br /> <b>Questionnaires: </b>EComIN prides itself on a tested and proven process that delivers consistent results. The first step of onboarding any new PPC account starts with requesting the client fill out questionnaires, not only about PPC, but about their target buyers, and their competition. We’re more than PPC managers, we’re marketing strategists who take a holistic view of any marketing challenge. </li>
                                        <li><b>Step 2</b><br /> <b>Audit of Current Account: </b>Our first step is to always assess and evaluate the current condition of the PPC account we’re taking over. eComIN has created a custom PPC account audit process and checklist based on years of analysing accounts. This audit helps us shine light on low hanging fruit opportunities, as well as points out potential red flags. We breakdown the current account to learn as much as we can from past performance,
                                            and then benchmark all KPIs as a baseline.
                                        </li>
                                        <li><b>Step 3</b><br /> <b>Kickoff Meeting: </b>It’s important to start things off on the right foot. Every new client receives a kickoff meeting with the full team to review our timeline and walk through each step of the setup process. We also use this meeting for discovery where we review completed questionnaires. </li>
                                        <li><b>Step 4</b><br /> <b>Keyword Research: </b>If we’re running a search campaign, our next step is perform keyword research (based on any missing opportunities found in the audit). We break our proposed new keyword list down into groups and submit back to the client for approval before inputting keywords into the account. </li>
                                        <li><b>Step 5</b><br /> <b>Account Setup or Restructuring: </b>This step includes optimising all the various account settings, such as: Campaign setup, Ad Group setup, Ad Copywriting & Testing setup, Match Type setup, Extensions setup, Bids setup, Goal Tracking setup, Call Tracking, Ad Design (for display and remarking campaigns), Negative Keywords setup, and Audience/In Market Targeting setup </li>
                                        <li><b>Step 6</b><br /> <b>Ad Writing: </b>Writing PPC ads is a balance of art and science. The ads need to be persuasive, yet informative, yet direct, all within very tight character limits. Luckily eComIN has a team of experienced copywriters who have been writing PPC ads for years. We also consistently test ad copy to determine what works best, so we have an arsenal of data to build off of. </li>
                                        <li><b>Step 7</b><br /> <b>Ad Design: </b>If we’re running display campaigns, eComIN will design multiple flights of ads in the chosen ad platform’s recommended ad size dimensions. Our ads are designed to be enticing and eye-catching, while still representing our clients’ brand. </li>
                                        <li><b>Step 8</b><br /> <b>Landing Page Setup: </b>The ads are only half the equation. To have meaningful PPC success, the ads need to drive users to a landing page that will convert them. eComIN will help write, design, and develop best practices landing pages for your campaigns. We’ve formed our own landing page best practices based on years of testing different landing page formats. </li>
                                        <li><b>Step 9</b><br /> <b>Report Creation: </b>EComIN creates a custom dashboard report for each client. To start off, EComIN
                                            imports in all historical data and then we update our main dashboard report every month. eComIN reports on metrics in plain english. We pride ourselves on reporting in the language of your business (leads, sales) and we don’t try to mislead you with vanity metrics. We provide and review reports with clients on a monthly basis. That said, you’ll always have full access to your account and can log in at any time to review metrics.
                                        </li>
                                        <li><b>Step 10</b><br /> <b>Weekly Calls/Meetings Scheduled: </b>It’s critical that we’re constantly communicating with our clients about the status of their PPC campaigns. Therefore, we schedule weekly (or monthly) calls/meetings to provide status updates. The size of the campaign and budget will determine if a weekly check in is required, or if a monthly check in will do. </li>
                                    </ul>
                                </div>

                                        <p>Every agency will approach PPC from a different angle. Here are the nine core beliefs our PPC program is based on: </p>

                                            <li>You Own the Account
                                                Your PPC account is an asset. You paid for it to be built and optimised, and you should own it, regardless of who your PPC management agency is.

                                            <li>Optimize for Conversions
                                                You care about leads and/or sales, not clicks, or impressions, or click-through-rate (CTR), or any other vanity metrics. We only optimise for the metrics your business understands and cares about.
                                            </li>
                                            <li>Report in Natural Language
                                                We report on the metrics your business cares about, and spare you the technical gibberish. Unless you want to nerd out, then we’re happy to talk shop.

                                            <li><b>No Silos:</b>
                                                eComIN’s PPC program is built to support the efforts of our overall digital marketing department, specifically content marketing, conversion rate optimisation (CRO) and search engine optimisation (SEO).
                                            </li>
                                            <li><b>No Long-Term Contracts:</b>Our PPC contracts run month-to-month and require 30 days notice to cancel. We believe the best way to keep a client around is to do an amazing job, not lock them into a long-term contract.</li>
                                            <li><b>No Autopilot:</b>We manually manage campaigns on a daily and/or weekly basis depending on the velocity of the spend. This ensures our PPC managers are always keeping a pulse on the account performance and making improvements quickly. </li>
                                            <li><b>Dedicated Account Manager:</b>Each client has a dedicated point of contact, who provides weekly updates, responds to any questions in less than 24 hours, attends weekly or monthly calls, and is available for questions whenever needed. Our account managers will also continually post updates for clients on our project management software, Basecamp. </li>
                                            <li><b>Have The Best People:</b>While we use some technology to track and tweak campaigns, the people we have managing the accounts are the reason for performance improvements. From our account managers, to PPC specialists, to graphic designers and web developers, we invest heavily in recruiting and retaining the most-talented people around. Don’t believe us?

                                            <li><b>Set a New High Score:</b>When eComIN takes over any new PPC accounts, our goal is to set a new high score. While maintaining an account is great, that’s not what drives us. We’re passionate about showing how much we can improve when given the opportunity. It’s not uncommon for us to increase conversions by 50-90% (while driving down the costs) in the first several months. </li>
